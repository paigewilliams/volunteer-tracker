## Description

This is an exercise in using custom Postgres databases and implementing raw SQL into Ruby. The goal of this project is to create a website to track volunteers working on a project. Each project can have many volunteers, but each volunteer can only work on one project at a time. Volunteers and projects, can be added, updated and deleted.
